# Lucra Components (Experimental)

Lucra Components are embedded UI pieces exposed by the SDK. The React Native SDK exposes `LucraFlowView` for embedding flows, but additional component-level APIs are not yet documented.

If you need specific components beyond `LucraFlowView`, contact your Lucra representative for current availability and usage.
