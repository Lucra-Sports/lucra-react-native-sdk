# Tournament Events

Use the contest listener to receive tournament events.

```ts
const unsubscribe = LucraSDK.addContestListener({
  onTournamentJoined: (id: string) => {
    console.log('Tournament joined:', id);
  },
});

// Call this when you no longer need the listener (e.g., on unmount).
unsubscribe();
```
